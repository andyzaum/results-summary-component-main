## My process
  For this project, my biggest challenge was CSS. I had issues with centering <divs> and a proper understanding of how responsiveness works. In this project, I used many units that were changed from 'px' to 'vw' or 'vh', which allowed me greater ease in working with different screen types. Besides, I also created elements like the <ball> and the <div.container>, which exist solely for styling purposes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - SCSS


### What I learned

With this project, I was able to learn CSS usage better because, as I had mentioned, I had difficulties with element alignment and styling. It was a challenge that brought a lot of clarity to my studies.


### Continued development

I still struggle with selecting CSS units, but I believe it's not something that will hinder me in the long run. I want to start focusing more on JavaScript now, so I can work in the front-end field without any difficulties .
